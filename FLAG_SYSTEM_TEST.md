## ðŸ§ª How to Test

### Prerequisites
1. Development server running at http://localhost:3000
2. Navigate to the main demo page

### Test Steps

1. **Open Social Accounts Modal**
   - Look for any "Social Accounts" section with a "View all" button
   - Click "View all" to open the connected accounts modal

2. **View Available Accounts**
   - Should see accounts organized by category (Social Media, Professional, Creative, Tech)
   - Each account should have a flag button (ðŸš©) on the right side

3. **Test Flag Functionality**
   - Click the flag button (ðŸš©) on any account
   - Flag modal should open with:
     - Account info at the top
     - Daily limit warning based on trust score
     - Four radio button categories
     - Evidence text area (20 char minimum)
     - Actual profile URL field
     - Consequences explanation (click to show/hide)

4. **Test Form Validation**
   - Try submitting without selections - should be disabled
   - Select category and add evidence (less than 20 chars) - should remain disabled
   - Add valid URL and 20+ character evidence - submit button should enable

5. **Test Flag Submission**
   - Complete the form and submit
   - Account should disappear from the display
   - Modal should close
   - Account count in footer should decrease

6. **Test Multiple Accounts**
   - Flag multiple accounts to verify independent state management
   - Verify each flagged account is hidden properly

### Expected Behavior

- âœ… Flag buttons appear on all accounts
- âœ… Flag modal opens with proper validation
- âœ… Daily limits display correctly (3 flags for default 75 trust score)
- âœ… Form validation prevents invalid submissions
- âœ… Flagged accounts are hidden from display
- âœ… Statistics update to exclude flagged accounts
- âœ… No TypeScript errors or console warnings
